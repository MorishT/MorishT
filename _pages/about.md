A machine learning (mainly NLP) researcher at the Hitachi central laboratory.  

I'm developing NLP technologies (and sometimes multimodal technologies that also incorporate speech/image) to help people make better decisions.  

I'm also interested in generic machine learning technologies such as reinforcement learning and ensemble learning.
