**A machine learning researcher** at the Hitachi central laboratory.  

I'm mainly developing **NLP** technologies (and sometimes **multimodal technologies** that also incorporate speech/image) to help people make better decisions.
I'm also interested in generic machine learning technologies such as **reinforcement learning** and ensemble learning.  

In my past life at the University of Tokyo, I studied particle- and astro- physics at the [Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe](https://www.ipmu.jp/ja) under the supervision of Prof. [Hitoshi Murayama](https://www.ipmu.jp/ja/hitoshi-murayama).
